All notable changes to the JIRA Sync Dashboard project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-01-09] - Core Business Fields & Architecture Documentation

### üéØ Major Feature: Core Business Fields Implementation
- ‚úÖ **Database Migration Completed**
  - Successfully added 25 core business fields to `jira_issues_v2` table
  - Fields cover: Order Information, Media/Delivery, Editing/Production, Workflow Timestamps, Location/Instructions
  - All columns created with appropriate data types (VARCHAR, TEXT, INTEGER, TIMESTAMP, BOOLEAN)
  
- ‚úÖ **Field Mapping Configuration**
  - Created `/backend/config/core_field_mappings.json` with comprehensive field definitions
  - Organized fields into 6 logical groups for better management
  - Included known Instance 1 custom field IDs (e.g., customfield_10501 for order number)
  - Prepared placeholders for Instance 2 field discovery
  
- ‚úÖ **Verification Tools**
  - Created `verify_field_mappings.py` script to identify missing field mappings
  - Script provides field search capabilities and mapping suggestions
  - Can identify unmapped fields and suggest matches from cached data

### üìö New Documentation
- ‚úÖ **SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md**
  - Comprehensive explanation of field mapping architecture
  - Detailed sync logic flow between JIRA instances
  - Database design philosophy (one column per business concept)
  - Real-world examples with actual field IDs
  
- ‚úÖ **CORE_FIELDS_README.md**
  - Complete guide to all 25 core business fields
  - Field categories and purposes explained
  - Database schema documentation
  - Setup and troubleshooting instructions
  
- ‚úÖ **Updated FIELD_MAPPING_GUIDE.md**
  - Added incremental field addition documentation
  - Explained field grouping by name
  - Database column strategy clarification

### üîß Mapping Wizard Improvements
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Incremental Field Addition**
  - Wizard now appends new fields instead of replacing existing configuration
  - Existing "Wizard Fields" group is preserved and merged with new selections
  - Fields with same name are updated rather than duplicated
  - Toast messages show both new fields added and total field count
  
- ‚úÖ **Field Grouping Enhancement**
  - Fields with same name but different custom IDs are shown as single entry
  - Example: "NDPU Final Review Timestamp" appears once with both instance IDs listed
  - Automatic mapping of both instance IDs to same database column

### üìä Database Schema Updates
The following fields were successfully added to `jira_issues_v2`:

| Field Category | Fields Added |
|---------------|--------------|
| Order Info | ndpu_order_number, ndpu_client_name, ndpu_client_email, ndpu_listing_address |
| Media/Delivery | ndpu_raw_photos, dropbox_raw_link, dropbox_edited_link, same_day_delivery |
| Editing/Production | escalated_editing, edited_media_revision_notes, ndpu_editing_team, ndpu_service |
| Workflow Timestamps | scheduled, acknowledged, at_listing, shoot_complete, uploaded, edit_start, final_review, closed |
| Location/Instructions | location_name, ndpu_comments, ndpu_editor_notes, ndpu_access_instructions, ndpu_special_instructions |

### Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Database migration applied successfully
2. ‚è≥ Run field discovery to find Instance 2 field IDs
3. ‚è≥ Use verification script to identify missing mappings
4. ‚è≥ Complete field configuration using mapping wizard
