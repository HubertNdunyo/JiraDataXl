  - Now requires explicit `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable
  - Server refuses to start without proper configuration
  - Prevents unauthorized admin access

  - Removed hard-coded JIRA instance URLs (`betteredits.atlassian.net`)
  - All URLs now from environment variables (`JIRA_URL_1`, `JIRA_URL_2`)
  - Supports easy instance switching without code changes
  - Improves deployment flexibility

- **Input Validation**
  - Enforced minimum 2-minute scheduler interval (Pydantic validation)
  - Prevents API rate limiting issues
  - All API inputs validated with proper schemas

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements
- **Removed Global State Anti-patterns**
  - Eliminated global `_sync_manager` variables throughout codebase

  - `GET /issues/recent` - 1 minute TTL cache
  - Reduces database load for frequently accessed data
  - Decorators for easy cache application

- **Real JIRA Health Checks**
  - Actual connectivity tests using `/myself` endpoint
  - Async implementation for non-blocking checks
  - Per-instance health status reporting

  - Example: "NDPU Final Review Timestamp" appears once with both instance IDs listed
  - Automatic mapping of both instance IDs to same database column

### üìä Database Schema Updates
The following fields were successfully added to `jira_issues_v2`:

| Field Category | Fields Added |
|---------------|--------------|
| Order Info | ndpu_order_number, ndpu_client_name, ndpu_client_email, ndpu_listing_address |
