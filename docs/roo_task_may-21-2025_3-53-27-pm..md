Can you do an analysis of these project, especially around error reporting, how does the app handle failed downloads, downloads that have been stuck with the status of pending, queued, transfer failed, something that i have noted is that whever i restart the app and a download has those statuses they tend to get stuck

**Assistant:**

Okay, I'll analyze the project with a focus on error reporting and how it handles failed or stuck downloads, especially concerning restarts.

Based on your description, here are some potential areas where issues might arise when downloads get stuck after a restart:

1.  **State Persistence and Recovery:** The application might not be correctly saving the state of downloads before a shutdown, or it might not be properly re-reading and interpreting that state upon restart. This could leave downloads in an indeterminate state that the application no longer knows how to process.
2.  **Job Initialization Logic:** On startup, the logic that scans for and resumes pending, queued, or failed downloads might have flaws. It might overlook certain statuses, fail to correctly re-initialize download attempts, or not handle edge cases where a download was interrupted mid-process.
3.  **Locking Mechanisms:** If there are any locking mechanisms to prevent multiple instances from processing the same download, these locks might not be released properly on shutdown or cleared on startup, preventing new instances from picking up the jobs.
4.  **Orphaned Processes/Tasks:** A download process might have been orphaned during a restart, and the application might not have a robust way to detect and reconcile these orphaned tasks with the job entries in the database.
5.  **Error Handling during Retry:** The retry mechanism itself might have bugs. For example, if a download fails and is queued for retry, an application restart might interrupt the retry scheduling, or the retry logic might not correctly pick up jobs that were previously marked for retry.
6.  **Database Inconsistencies:** The database state for a download might become inconsistent if an operation is interrupted by a restart. For example, a status update might not have completed, leaving the job in a state that the startup logic doesn't handle.
7.  **External Dependencies:** If downloads depend on external services (e.g., availability of a file source, network connectivity), the application might not be re-checking these dependencies or handling their unavailability gracefully after a restart.

The most likely sources, given your description of downloads getting "stuck" after a restart with statuses like "pending," "queued," or "transfer failed," are:
*   **Flawed state recovery on startup:** The application isn't correctly identifying and re-queueing or resuming these downloads from the database.
*   **Issues in the job monitoring/processing logic:** The component responsible for picking up and processing downloads might not be robust enough to handle jobs that were in an intermediate state before the restart.

To validate these assumptions, I'll need to examine the code responsible for managing download states, job processing, and application startup routines.

I'll start by looking at the [`backend/src/services/downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) file to understand how downloads are initiated and managed.

**Assistant:**

Okay, I've reviewed the [`backend/src/services/downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) file.

Here's a summary of the relevant findings:

*   **Startup Reset Logic:**
    *   The `resetStuckDownloads` function (lines 10-34) specifically targets downloads with the status `'downloading'` upon server restart. It changes their status to `'failed'` and logs this action.
    *   The `resetStuckTransfers` function (lines 37-63) targets downloads with status `'transferring'` or `'extracting'`. It sets their main `status` to `'completed'` and `transfer_status` to `'transfer_failed'`, logging this.
*   **`activeDownloads` Set:**
    *   An in-memory `Set` called `activeDownloads` (line 68) tracks `issueKey`s of downloads currently being processed by the main `downloadFile` function. This is used to prevent duplicate processing of the same download simultaneously. It's cleared in a `finally` block, so it should be empty on a fresh start after a crash/restart.

**Key Observation & Potential Issue:**

The startup scripts (`resetStuckDownloads` and `resetStuckTransfers`) **only handle downloads that were actively in `'downloading'`, `'transferring'`, or `'extracting'` states.**

You mentioned that downloads stuck with statuses like `'pending'` or `'queued'` are problematic after a restart. The current startup logic in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) **does not appear to explicitly address or reset jobs that were in `'pending'` or `'queued'` state in the database when the server stopped.**

If a job was:
1.  Created in the database with status `'queued'` (as `downloadFile` does on line 196: `attempt = await db.createDownloadAttempt({ issueKey, summary, downloadUrl }, 'queued');`)
2.  And the server restarted *before* this job was picked up and its status changed to `'downloading'` (line 258),
then it would remain `'queued'` in the database. The existing reset functions wouldn't touch it.

The same logic applies to any jobs that might enter a `'pending'` state through other means, if that status is used.

**Next Steps & Logging Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm the Hypothesis:** My primary hypothesis is that the application lacks a mechanism at startup to re-process or correctly re-initialize downloads that were left in `'pending'` or `'queued'` states in the database.
2.  **Investigate Job Processing:** We need to understand how jobs in `'pending'` or `'queued'` states are normally picked up for processing. This logic is likely in a separate job monitoring or queue management service. The file [`backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js) is a prime candidate.
3.  **Add Logging:**
    *   We can add logging to the existing `resetStuckDownloads` and `resetStuckTransfers` functions to be more explicit about the states they *are* checking and what they find (or don't find).
    *   Crucially, we'll need to inspect and potentially add logging to the service responsible for picking up queued jobs (likely [`jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js)) to see how it behaves on startup and whether it re-scans for existing queued items.

Let's start by adding some more detailed logging to the startup routines in [`backend/src/services/downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js). This will help us confirm what these functions are seeing and not seeing.

Here's the proposed change:

**Assistant:**

The logging changes in [`backend/src/services/downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) have been applied. This will give us clearer information in the logs about what the startup reset functions are doing.

Now, let's examine [`backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js). This file is likely responsible for polling the database for new or queued jobs and initiating their download. We need to see how it handles startup and if it has a mechanism to pick up jobs that were already in a `'queued'` or `'pending'` state before a restart.

**User:**

[ERROR] You did not use a tool in your previous response! Please retry with a tool use.

# Reminder: Instructions for Tool Use

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name itself becomes the XML tag name. Each parameter is enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<actual_tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</actual_tool_name>

For example, to use the attempt_completion tool:

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have completed the task...
</result>
</attempt_completion>

Always use the actual tool name as the XML tag name for proper parsing and execution.

# Next Steps

If you have completed the user's task, use the attempt_completion tool. 
If you require additional information from the user, use the ask_followup_question tool. 
Otherwise, if you have not completed the task and do not need additional information, then proceed with the next step of the task.

**Assistant:**

I've analyzed [`backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js). Here's what I found:

*   **Startup Behavior:** The `startMonitoring()` function (lines 364-378) is called when the job monitor begins. It immediately executes `checkJobs()` once and then sets up a recurring interval for `checkJobs()`.
*   **`checkJobs()` Function (lines 28-100):** This is the main loop.
    *   It determines available download slots.
    *   Crucially, it calls `await db.getJobsToDownload(slotsAvailable)` (line 57) to fetch jobs that are ready to be processed. The logic within `db.getJobsToDownload()` is key to understanding if it picks up jobs that were already `'queued'` or `'pending'` before a restart.
    *   It then iterates through these jobs and calls `downloadFile(job)` for each.
*   **`checkForStuckJobs()` Function (lines 272-359):**
    *   This function runs as part of the `checkJobs()` cycle.
    *   It explicitly queries for jobs that have been in `'downloading'` or `'queued'` status for over 30 minutes and resets them to `'failed'`.
    *   It also handles jobs stuck in `'transferring'` or `'extracting'` for over 60 minutes.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The `resetStuckDownloads` and `resetStuckTransfers` functions in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) handle jobs that were actively being processed (`'downloading'`, `'transferring'`, `'extracting'`) during a shutdown.

When `jobMonitor.js` starts, its initial `checkJobs()` call relies on `db.getJobsToDownload()`.
If `db.getJobsToDownload()` *only* fetches jobs with a very specific initial status (e.g., 'newly_added') and doesn't also look for existing `'queued'` jobs, then jobs that were `'queued'` in the database *before* the restart might be missed by this initial scan.

The `checkForStuckJobs()` function *would* eventually find these `'queued'` jobs, but only after they've been in that state for 30 minutes. This delay could be why they appear "stuck" immediately after a restart.

**Next Steps & Logging:**

To confirm this, we need to understand the SQL query used by `db.getJobsToDownload()`. This function is likely defined in [`backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js).

1.  **Examine `db.getJobsToDownload()`:** I'll read this function to see its query logic.
2.  **Add Logging:**
    *   Add a log statement within `db.getJobsToDownload()` to output the exact SQL query it's using.
    *   Add a log at the very beginning of the `checkJobs` function in [`jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js) to clearly indicate when a cycle starts, especially the first one after application startup.
    *   Add more specific logging in `checkForStuckJobs` when it finds and resets jobs that were specifically in the `'queued'` state.

Let's start by reading the contents of [`backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js).

**Assistant:**

I've reviewed [`backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js), specifically the `getJobsToDownload` function (lines 7-82).

Here's the crucial part of the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    j.issue_key, j.summary, j.status as jira_status,
    j.dropbox_raw_link, j.uploaded
FROM public.jira_issues_v2 j
WHERE
    j.status IN ('Uploaded', 'Edit') -- Condition 1: Jira status must be 'Uploaded' or 'Edit'
    AND j.dropbox_raw_link IS NOT NULL AND j.dropbox_raw_link <> '' -- Condition 2: Must have a download link
    AND j.uploaded > NOW() - INTERVAL '${timeWindowHours} hours' -- Condition 3: Uploaded recently
    ${filterConditions} -- Dynamic filters for service, team, location
    AND NOT EXISTS ( -- Condition 4: No active or recent attempts
        SELECT 1 FROM job_downloads da_active
        WHERE da_active.issue_key = j.issue_key
        AND da_active.status IN ('queued', 'downloading', 'transferring', 'extracting') -- Excludes if already being processed
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS ( -- Condition 5: No recently completed/failed attempts
        SELECT 1 FROM job_downloads da_done
        WHERE da_done.issue_key = j.issue_key
        AND da_done.ended_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '${completedRecencyHours} hours' -- Excludes if recently finished
    )
ORDER BY j.uploaded ASC
LIMIT $${paramIndex};
```

**Analysis of `getJobsToDownload`:**

*   This function selects jobs from `jira_issues_v2` that are in `'Uploaded'` or `'Edit'` status and have a download link.
*   **Crucially (Condition 4):** It uses `NOT EXISTS` to exclude any `issue_key` that already has an entry in the `job_downloads` table with a status of `'queued'`, `'downloading'`, `'transferring'`, or `'extracting'`.
*   **Also (Condition 5):** It excludes jobs that have had *any* attempt (successful or failed) end recently.

**Confirmation of Hypothesis:**

This confirms the hypothesis. If a download attempt record was created with status `'queued'` in the `job_downloads` table (as `downloadFile` does in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js:196)) and the server restarted *before* that job was processed further, then:

1.  The `resetStuckDownloads` function in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) would **not** touch it because its status is `'queued'`, not `'downloading'`.
2.  The `getJobsToDownload` function in [`jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js) would **not** pick it up for a new download attempt because Condition 4 (`NOT EXISTS ... WHERE da_active.status IN ('queued', ...`) would exclude it. The job already exists in `job_downloads` with a `'queued'` status.

So, these jobs remain in the `'queued'` state in the database and are not actively picked up by the normal job processing flow after a restart. They would only be addressed by the `checkForStuckJobs` function in [`jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js) after 30 minutes, which marks them as `'failed'`. This explains why they appear "stuck" in `'queued'` or `'pending'` (if `'pending'` is an initial UI state before a `job_downloads` record is made).

**Logging and Solution Strategy:**

The next step is to add logging to confirm this behavior in action and then propose a fix.

**Logging:**

1.  **In [`backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js):**
    *   Log the generated SQL query within `getJobsToDownload` to see exactly what's being run.
    *   Log the `issue_key`s it *does* find, and if it finds none.
2.  **In [`backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js):**
    *   Add a log at the very beginning of `startMonitoring()` to clearly mark the job monitor's startup.
    *   Add a log at the beginning of each `checkJobs()` cycle.
    *   In `checkForStuckJobs()`, when it finds jobs stuck in `'queued'` state, log this very specifically, including the `issue_key` and how long it's been stuck.

Let's apply these logging changes.

First, to [`backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js):

**Assistant:**

Excellent. All the planned logging has been applied to:
*   [`backend/src/services/downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js)
*   [`backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js)
*   [`backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js)

**Diagnosis Confirmation Next:**

With these logs in place, the next step is for you to:
1.  Restart the application.
2.  Observe the console output, paying close attention to the new log messages from `[Downloader]`, `[getJobsToDownload]`, and `[Job Monitor]`.
3.  Specifically, check if jobs that you know were previously in a `'queued'` state (and get stuck) are:
    *   **Not** reset by `resetStuckDownloads` in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) (because they aren't in `'downloading'` status).
    *   **Not** picked up by `getJobsToDownload` in [`jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js) (because they already exist with `'queued'` status in `job_downloads`).
    *   Eventually found and reset to `'failed'` by `checkForStuckJobs` in [`jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js) after about 30 minutes.

This will confirm our diagnosis that jobs left in the `'queued'` state in the `job_downloads` table after a restart are not being correctly re-processed by the current logic.

**Assistant:**

Certainly. Here's a non-code explanation of the diagnosis and the logging we've added:

**The Problem We're Investigating:**

You've observed that when the application restarts, downloads that were in a "pending," "queued," or "transfer failed" state tend to get stuck. They don't resume or get processed correctly.

**My Current Understanding (The Diagnosis):**

1.  **Initial State:** A download task is identified (e.g., from Jira). The system creates an entry for this download in its `job_downloads` database table and marks its initial status as `"queued"`. This means it's waiting to be picked up by a downloader.
2.  **Normal Processing (No Restart):**
    *   The "Job Monitor" service regularly checks for jobs.
    *   It uses a function (which we now know is `getJobsToDownload`) to find tasks in the main `jira_issues_v2` table that are eligible for download *and don't already have an active or recent attempt* in `job_downloads`.
    *   If it finds such a new task, it would then trigger the `downloadFile` function. `downloadFile` first creates a record in `job_downloads` with status `'queued'`, then changes it to `'downloading'` once the actual download starts.
3.  **What Happens on Restart (The Suspected Issue):**
    *   **Scenario:** A download task had its entry created in `job_downloads` with status `"queued"`, but the server restarted *before* the status was changed to `"downloading"`.
    *   **Startup Scripts in `downloader.js`:**
        *   One script (`resetStuckDownloads`) looks for jobs that were actively `"downloading"` and marks them as `"failed"`. Our "queued" job is missed here.
        *   Another script (`resetStuckTransfers`) looks for jobs that were actively `"transferring"` or `"extracting"` and marks them appropriately (e.g., `"transfer_failed"`). Our "queued" job is also missed here.
    *   **Job Monitor Starts (`jobMonitor.js`):**
        *   It runs its `checkJobs` cycle.
        *   It calls `getJobsToDownload` (from `jobs.js`) to find new tasks.
        *   **The Key Problem:** The `getJobsToDownload` function is designed to find tasks in `jira_issues_v2` that *do not yet have* an active entry (like 'queued', 'downloading', etc.) in the `job_downloads` table. Since our stuck job *already has* an entry in `job_downloads` with the status `"queued"`, `getJobsToDownload` will *not* select it as a new job to process.
    *   **The "Stuck" State:** The job remains in the `job_downloads` table with status `"queued"`. The main mechanism for picking up new jobs ignores it.
    *   **Eventual Timeout (`checkForStuckJobs` in `jobMonitor.js`):** After about 30 minutes, a safety function called `checkForStuckJobs` runs. It finds any jobs that have been in `"queued"` (or `"downloading"`) state for too long and forcibly changes their status to `"failed"`. This is when you might see the status finally change, but not in the way you want (it didn't get processed).

**What the Added Logging Aims to Show:**

To confirm this sequence of events, we've added log messages at key points:

1.  **In `downloader.js` (Startup Resets):**
    *   The logs will now be more specific about which statuses (`"downloading"`, `"transferring"`, `"extracting"`) the reset scripts are looking for and whether they find any jobs in those states. This should show that "queued" jobs are *not* being touched by these initial reset scripts.
2.  **In `database/jobs.js` (`getJobsToDownload` function):**
    *   This function will now log the exact SQL query it uses to find new jobs.
    *   It will also log which `issue_key`s (if any) it finds that it considers "new" and eligible for download. We expect it *not* to list the `issue_key`s of jobs that were already "queued" in `job_downloads` before the restart.
3.  **In `jobMonitor.js`:**
    *   Logs will clearly indicate when the Job Monitor service starts up and when each of its `checkJobs` cycles begins. This helps trace the timeline.
    *   The `checkForStuckJobs` function will now log more detailed information when it finds a job that has been stuck, especially if it was stuck in the `"queued"` state. It will tell us which job it is and how long it was stuck before being reset to "failed".

By observing these logs after a restart, we should be able to see if "queued" jobs are indeed ignored by the initial processing and only dealt with much later by the timeout mechanism.

Does this explanation clarify the logic we're testing with the logs?

**Assistant:**

The logs you've provided are very helpful and align with our diagnosis. Let's break down what they show:

1.  **`[getJobsToDownload] Executing query: ...`**: We see the SQL query. The key condition here is `AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM job_downloads da_active WHERE da_active.issue_key = j.issue_key AND da_active.status IN ('queued', 'downloading', 'transferring', 'extracting') ... )`.
    *   This means the function is specifically looking for jobs in the main `jira_issues_v2` table that **do not** already have an entry in the `job_downloads` table with a status like `'queued'`, `'downloading'`, etc.

2.  **`[getJobsToDownload] No new eligible jobs found to start downloading based on current criteria.`**: This log message directly indicates that the query above found zero new jobs from `jira_issues_v2` that meet all its conditions (including not already being 'queued' in `job_downloads`).

3.  **`[Job Monitor] No eligible jobs found to process.`**: Consequently, the Job Monitor has no new jobs to send to the `downloadFile` function in this cycle.

4.  **`[Job Monitor] No stuck downloads found`** and **`[Job Monitor] No stuck transfers found`**: These messages come from the `checkForStuckJobs` function. If you had jobs that were `'queued'` in the `job_downloads` table just before restarting, this function wouldn't flag them as "stuck" immediately. It only considers a job "stuck" if it has been in a state like `'queued'` or `'downloading'` for over 30 minutes. So, it's normal for these messages to appear initially if the 30-minute threshold hasn't been met for those pre-existing 'queued' jobs.

**Confirmation of Diagnosis:**

These logs confirm a critical part of our diagnosis:
*   If a download attempt was created with `status = 'queued'` in the `job_downloads` table, and the application restarted, the `getJobsToDownload` function will **not** pick this job up again to start a new download process. This is because the job already exists in `job_downloads` with a 'queued' status, and `getJobsToDownload` is designed to find tasks that *haven't* been processed to that stage yet.

The full diagnosed behavior is that these 'queued' jobs would remain untouched until the `checkForStuckJobs` function in `jobMonitor.js` identifies them as stuck (after 30 minutes) and resets their status to `'failed'`.

**Proposed Solution:**

To address this and ensure 'queued' jobs are properly handled after a restart, I propose a two-part modification:

1.  **Modify `resetStuckDownloads` in [`backend/src/services/downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js):**
    *   Currently, this function only resets jobs that were in `'downloading'` status to `'failed'` on startup.
    *   We'll change it to also reset jobs that were in `'queued'` status to `'failed'`. This ensures that any job interrupted while waiting in the queue is clearly marked as having failed due to the restart.

2.  **Modify `retryFailedDownload` in [`backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js):**
    *   Currently, when this function processes a failed download, it updates its retry count and sets its status back to `'queued'`, with a comment suggesting the main job loop will pick it up. However, as we've seen, `getJobsToDownload` (part of the main loop for *new* jobs) will ignore it.
    *   We'll change `retryFailedDownload` so that after updating the retry count and status, it will **directly call the `downloadFile` function** for that specific job. This will actively re-initiate the download process for the retried job, rather than passively waiting.

This approach ensures that:
*   Jobs interrupted in the 'queued' state are explicitly handled at startup.
*   The existing retry mechanism for failed downloads will then actively restart these (and other genuinely failed) downloads.

Okay, I will proceed with applying the changes.

First, I'll modify the `resetStuckDownloads` function in [`backend/src/services/downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) to also reset jobs that were in `'queued'` status to `'failed'` on startup.

**Assistant:**

The changes to `resetStuckDownloads` in [`backend/src/services/downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) have been applied. Now, jobs that were `'queued'` at the time of a restart will also be marked as `'failed'`.

Next, I'll modify the `retryFailedDownload` function in [`backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js) to directly call `downloadFile` after preparing the job for a retry.

The modification to `retryFailedDownload` now attempts to fetch full job details using a new function `db.getJobDetailsForAttempt()` before calling `downloadFile()`. This new database function `db.getJobDetailsForAttempt()` does not exist yet. We need to define it in [`backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js) to ensure the retry mechanism works correctly.

This function should take an `attempt_id` and return the necessary `issueKey`, `summary`, and `downloadUrl` for that attempt, likely by joining `job_downloads` with `jira_issues_v2`.

Let's define `db.getJobDetailsForAttempt()` in [`backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js).

**Assistant:**

Excellent, the new `getJobDetailsForAttempt` function has been added to [`backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js).

With this final piece in place, the proposed solution is now fully implemented:

1.  **Startup Handling in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js):**
    *   The `resetStuckDownloads` function will now mark any jobs found in `'queued'` (in addition to `'downloading'`) status in the `job_downloads` table as `'failed'` when the application starts. This ensures interrupted queued jobs are explicitly handled.

2.  **Retry Mechanism in [`jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js) (and [`database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js)):**
    *   The `checkFailedDownloads` function will identify these (and other) `'failed'` jobs that are eligible for retry.
    *   The `retryFailedDownload` function will:
        *   Increment their `download_retry_count`.
        *   Set their status back to `'queued'`.
        *   Use the new `getJobDetailsForAttempt` function (in [`database/jobs.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobs.js)) to fetch the necessary `issueKey`, `summary`, and `downloadUrl`.
        *   **Crucially, it will then directly call `downloadFile()`** (from [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js)) to actively re-initiate the download process for that specific job.

**Expected Outcome:**

After a restart, jobs that were previously stuck in `'queued'` will:
1.  Be marked as `'failed'` by `resetStuckDownloads`.
2.  Be picked up by `checkFailedDownloads` (if they haven't exceeded max retries).
3.  Be actively re-queued and re-downloaded by `retryFailedDownload` calling `downloadFile` directly.

This should resolve the issue of downloads getting stuck in `'pending'` or `'queued'` states after an application restart.

The logging we added earlier will also help verify this new behavior.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I've implemented changes to address the issue of downloads getting stuck in 'queued' or 'pending' states after an application restart.

Here's a summary of the fix:
1.  **Enhanced Startup Reset:** The `resetStuckDownloads` function in `backend/src/services/downloader.js` now also marks jobs that were in 'queued' status at the time of a restart as 'failed'. This ensures they are explicitly handled.
2.  **Active Retry Process:** The `retryFailedDownload` function in `backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js` has been modified. When it processes a failed download for retry:
    *   It fetches the full job details (using a new `getJobDetailsForAttempt` function added to `backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`).
    *   It then directly calls the `downloadFile` function to actively re-initiate the download for that job, rather than passively waiting for another part of the system to pick it up.

This two-pronged approach should ensure that jobs interrupted in the 'queued' state are correctly processed and retried after a server restart. The previously added logging will help confirm this new behavior.

**Assistant:**

The logs and screenshots are very insightful, thank you.

It appears the core issue of jobs getting stuck after a restart if they were in a 'queued' or 'downloading' state might still be persisting, or the fix isn't behaving entirely as expected.

Let's analyze:
*   **Screenshot 2 (GLBAY-17104):** Shows "Status: Failed" with "Last Error: Reset by job monitor - stuck in downloading/queued state". This is the action of the `checkForStuckJobs` function in [`jobMonitor.js`](backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js), which acts as a safety net after 30 minutes. This implies that for this job, the immediate handling at startup (our modified `resetStuckDownloads`) and the subsequent active retry (`checkFailedDownloads` -> `retryFailedDownload`) did not successfully process it, so it remained stuck until the 30-minute timeout.
*   **Logs:**
    *   `[getJobsToDownload] No new eligible jobs found...`: This is expected if no brand new Jira issues are ready.
    *   `[Job Monitor] No failed downloads eligible for retry found.`: This is the crucial line. If `resetStuckDownloads` correctly marked previously 'queued' or 'downloading' jobs as 'failed' (with the error message "Download process interrupted by server restart"), then this `checkFailedDownloads` step *should* be finding them to initiate a retry. The fact that it's not finding any suggests a potential issue in the chain:
        1.  Were there actually any jobs in 'queued' or 'downloading' state in the `job_downloads` table right before this restart?
        2.  Did `resetStuckDownloads` run and successfully update their status to 'failed'? (We added logging for this).
        3.  Does the `db.getFailedDownloadsToRetry()` function (which `checkFailedDownloads` uses) have criteria that are now unintentionally excluding these jobs? For example, it might be looking for a specific `error_message` pattern that doesn't match "Download process interrupted by server restart", or it might have other conditions (like retry count already exceeded, or a time window for retries).

**Revised Plan:**

Our primary goal now is to understand why jobs that *should* be marked 'failed' by `resetStuckDownloads` are not being picked up by `checkFailedDownloads`.

1.  **Verify `resetStuckDownloads` Execution:** We need to ensure the logs from `resetStuckDownloads` (in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js)) show that it's actually finding and resetting jobs from 'queued' or 'downloading' to 'failed' on startup. If you can, please check the very beginning of your application logs after a restart for messages like:
    *   `[Downloader] Checking for downloads stuck in "downloading" or "queued" status...`
    *   `[Downloader] Reset X stuck downloads (previously 'downloading' or 'queued') to 'failed' status.`
    *   `[Downloader] Job YYY (Attempt ID: ZZZ), previously 'queued', reset to 'failed'.`

2.  **Examine `db.getFailedDownloadsToRetry()`:** This is the most likely place where the disconnect is happening. This function determines which 'failed' jobs are eligible for another attempt. We need to see its SQL query. This function is likely located in [`backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js).

Let's start by reading [`backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js) to find the `getFailedDownloadsToRetry` function.

**Assistant:**

I've reviewed [`backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js) and found the `getFailedDownloadsToRetry` function (lines 199-220).

Here's the SQL query it uses:

```sql
SELECT
    attempt_id, issue_key, job_summary, download_url, download_retry_count
FROM job_downloads
WHERE
    status = 'failed' -- Condition 1: Must be 'failed'
    AND download_retry_count < $1 -- Condition 2: Retry count not exceeded (maxRetries)
    -- Optional: Add a time window to avoid retrying very old failures immediately
    -- AND ended_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY
    ended_at ASC -- Retry older failures first
LIMIT $2; -- (limit)
```

**Analysis:**

The query itself seems straightforward and correct for its purpose:
*   It selects jobs with `status = 'failed'`.
*   It ensures the `download_retry_count` is less than the `maxRetries` allowed.
*   It orders by `ended_at` to process older failures first.

**Why `checkFailedDownloads` might still report "No failed downloads eligible for retry found":**

Given this query, if `checkFailedDownloads` is not finding jobs that we *expect* to be retried (i.e., those set to 'failed' by `resetStuckDownloads`), the reasons could be:

1.  **`resetStuckDownloads` Didn't Run or Find Anything:**
    *   Perhaps there were no jobs actually in 'queued' or 'downloading' state in `job_downloads` at the exact moment of the last restart.
    *   Or, if there was an error within `resetStuckDownloads` itself, it might not have completed its task of updating statuses to 'failed'. The logs we added to `resetStuckDownloads` should clarify this. If you see messages like `[Downloader] Reset X stuck downloads...` and `[Downloader] Job YYY ... reset to 'failed'.`, then this part worked.

2.  **`download_retry_count` Already Exceeded:**
    *   If the jobs that were reset to 'failed' by `resetStuckDownloads` had *already* reached their maximum retry attempts *before* this restart, then `AND download_retry_count < $1` would exclude them. This is legitimate behavior.

3.  **No Jobs Actually in 'failed' Status:**
    *   This seems unlikely if `resetStuckDownloads` is working, but it's a possibility.

**Focusing on the Logs from `resetStuckDownloads`:**

The most critical piece of information right now is what the `resetStuckDownloads` function in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) logged when the application last started.

*   Did it log that it found and reset any jobs from 'queued' or 'downloading' to 'failed'?
*   If it did, what were the `issue_key`s and `attempt_id`s of those jobs?

If `resetStuckDownloads` *did* successfully mark jobs as 'failed', and those jobs *had not* exceeded their retry counts, then `getFailedDownloadsToRetry` *should* find them. If it's not, there's a subtle discrepancy we're missing.

Could you please:
1.  Confirm if you have jobs in your `job_downloads` table that are currently in 'queued' or 'downloading' status.
2.  Restart the application.
3.  Share the initial logs specifically from the `resetStuckDownloads` function in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) (they will appear very early in the startup sequence). We're looking for lines like:
    *   `[Downloader] Checking for downloads stuck in "downloading" or "queued" status...`
    *   `[Downloader] Reset X stuck downloads (previously 'downloading' or 'queued') to 'failed' status.`
    *   And for each reset job: `[Downloader] Job ABC-123 (Attempt ID: 12345), previously 'queued', reset to 'failed'.`

This will tell us if the very first step of our fix (marking them 'failed') is working as intended.

**Assistant:**

This is a very important finding! The presence of multiple `job_downloads` attempts for the same `issue_key`, especially those with the **exact same `started_at` timestamp** (like attempts 14309, 14310, 14311 for GLBAY-17104), strongly suggests a concurrency issue where multiple processes or threads are trying to initiate the download for the same job simultaneously.

Here's why this is problematic and how it relates to the "stuck" jobs:

1.  **Race Condition:**
    *   The `jobMonitor.js` calls `db.getJobsToDownload()` to find eligible jobs.
    *   If multiple instances of the backend process (e.g., if you're using PM2 in cluster mode, or if there's another mechanism for concurrent execution) call `db.getJobsToDownload()` at roughly the same time, they might *all* see `GLBAY-17104` as available before any of them can create the initial `job_downloads` record with `status: 'queued'`.
    *   This leads to each process calling `downloadFile('GLBAY-17104')`, and each `downloadFile` call then creating its own `job_downloads` attempt record (14309, 14310, 14311).
    *   The in-memory `activeDownloads` set in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) is process-specific. It cannot prevent another process from also picking up the same `issue_key`.

2.  **Consequences:**
    *   **Wasted Resources:** Multiple downloads of the same file occur.
    *   **Data Inconsistency:** You end up with several attempt records for one actual job, making it hard to track the true status. For GLBAY-17104:
        *   Attempt 14309: `extraction_failed`
        *   Attempt 14310: `extracted` (looks successful)
        *   Attempt 14311: `failed` (error: "Reset by job monitor - stuck in downloading/queued state", `download_retry_count: 4`) - This is the one that our previous fixes would target, but it's essentially an orphaned attempt due to the successful one (14310).
    *   **Stuck State Illusion:** Attempt 14311 got stuck and was reset. Even if our retry logic worked perfectly for *this attempt*, it's redundant because attempt 14310 already succeeded. The UI might show the "stuck" error from 14311 if it's looking at the latest attempt by `attempt_id` or `started_at` without considering the overall success for the `issue_key`.

**The `download_retry_count: 4` on attempt 14311:** This indicates that this specific attempt (14311) was indeed picked up by the retry logic multiple times after being marked 'failed' (likely by `resetStuckDownloads` or `checkForStuckJobs` initially). However, the retries for this specific orphaned attempt are not useful if another attempt (14310) already completed the job.

**Primary Suspect: PM2 Cluster Mode or Similar Concurrency**

The most common cause for this exact scenario (multiple records with identical start times) in a Node.js application managed by PM2 is running in **cluster mode**. Each process in the cluster acts independently regarding in-memory checks.

**Revised Plan - Addressing Concurrency:**

The core issue to fix now is preventing multiple concurrent initializations for the same `issue_key`.

1.  **Verify PM2 Configuration:** We need to check how PM2 is configured. The file [`backend/ecosystem.config.cjs`](backend/ecosystem.config.cjs) will tell us if it's running in cluster mode (e.g., `instances: 'max'` or a number > 1, and `exec_mode: 'cluster'`).
2.  **If Cluster Mode is Confirmed (or other concurrency is present):**
    *   The most robust solution is often to enforce uniqueness at the database level for active jobs. We can add a **unique partial index** to the `job_downloads` table. This index would ensure that you can only have one row for a given `issue_key` where the `status` is, for example, `'queued'` or `'downloading'`.
    *   When `db.createDownloadAttempt()` tries to insert a new 'queued' record, if another process has *just* inserted one, the database will reject the second insert due to the unique constraint violation. This error can then be caught, and the `downloadFile` function can gracefully exit, knowing another process is handling it.

Let's start by checking the PM2 configuration file.

**Assistant:**

This confirms it! The line `instances: 6` in your [`backend/ecosystem.config.cjs`](backend/ecosystem.config.cjs:5) means PM2 is running 6 instances of your backend application in cluster mode.

This is precisely why you're seeing multiple `job_downloads` records created for the same `issue_key` at the same time. Each of these 6 instances can independently:
1.  Call `db.getJobsToDownload()`.
2.  See the same `issue_key` (e.g., GLBAY-17104) as available because no `job_downloads` record for it exists yet with an active status.
3.  Proceed to call `downloadFile()`.
4.  Inside `downloadFile()`, each instance calls `db.createDownloadAttempt()`, leading to multiple rows being inserted into `job_downloads` for the same `issue_key` almost simultaneously.

The in-memory `activeDownloads` set in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js) is local to each of these 6 processes, so it cannot prevent this race condition between separate processes.

**Solution: Database-Level Uniqueness and Graceful Handling**

To solve this, we need to:

1.  **Enforce Uniqueness at the Database Level:** Create a unique partial index on the `job_downloads` table. This index will only allow one record for a given `issue_key` to exist if its `status` is one of the "active" states (e.g., 'queued', 'downloading', 'transferring', 'extracting').
2.  **Gracefully Handle Constraint Violations:** Modify the `createDownloadAttempt` function in [`backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js) to catch the unique constraint violation error. If this error occurs, it means another instance has just created the record, so the current instance should not proceed with the download for that job.

**Step 1: Create a Database Migration for the Unique Partial Index**

You'll need to add a new SQL migration file. Let's name it something like `add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql`.

Here's the content for the new migration file:
<write_to_file>
<path>backend/src/db/migrations/add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql</path>
<content>
-- Add a unique partial index to prevent duplicate active job download attempts for the same issue_key
-- This ensures that only one instance can have an 'active' (queued, downloading, transferring, extracting)
-- record for a given issue_key at any time.

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_unique_active_job_downloads
ON public.job_downloads (issue_key)
WHERE status IN ('queued', 'downloading', 'transferring', 'extracting');

COMMENT ON INDEX idx_unique_active_job_downloads IS 'Ensures only one active (queued, downloading, transferring, extracting) download attempt exists per issue_key.';

-- To revert this migration (if needed):
-- DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_unique_active_job_downloads;
</content>
<line_count>12</line_count>
</write_to_file>

After you create this file and run the migration against your database, the database itself will prevent duplicate active entries.

**Step 2: Modify `createDownloadAttempt` to Handle Errors**

Next, I'll propose the changes to [`backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js) to handle the potential unique constraint error.

First, please confirm if you're ready for me to provide the `apply_diff` for `createDownloadAttempt` after you've hypothetically created and applied the migration above.

**Assistant:**

Great, the migration file [`backend/src/db/migrations/add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql`](backend/src/db/migrations/add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql) has been created. You'll need to run this migration against your PostgreSQL database. (Typically, you might have a script like `npm run migrate` or use a tool like `node-pg-migrate` to apply migrations).

Assuming the migration is applied, let's now modify the `createDownloadAttempt` function in [`backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js) to gracefully handle the unique constraint violation.

The PostgreSQL error code for a unique constraint violation is `23505`. We'll check for this specific error.

**Assistant:**

Excellent. The `createDownloadAttempt` function in [`backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js) has been updated to gracefully handle unique constraint violations.

**Summary of Changes to Address Concurrency:**

1.  **PM2 Configuration:** We identified that `instances: 6` in [`backend/ecosystem.config.cjs`](backend/ecosystem.config.cjs:5) is the root cause of multiple processes attempting to download the same job.
2.  **Database Migration:** A new migration file [`backend/src/db/migrations/add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql`](backend/src/db/migrations/add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql) was created. This migration, when applied, will add a unique partial index to the `job_downloads` table. This index ensures that only one record can exist for a given `issue_key` if its `status` is 'queued', 'downloading', 'transferring', or 'extracting'.
3.  **Error Handling in Code:** The `createDownloadAttempt` function in [`backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js`](backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js) was modified to:
    *   Catch errors during the `INSERT` operation.
    *   Specifically check if the error code is `23505` (PostgreSQL's code for unique_violation).
    *   If it's a unique violation, it logs a warning and returns `null`. This signals to the calling function (`downloadFile` in [`downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js)) that another process has likely already created this active download attempt.

**How `downloadFile` Will Behave Now:**

In [`backend/src/services/downloader.js`](backend/src/services/downloader.js), the `downloadFile` function calls `createDownloadAttempt`:

```javascript
// (around line 196 in downloader.js)
attempt = await db.createDownloadAttempt({ issueKey, summary, downloadUrl }, 'queued');
if (!attempt) {
     console.error(`[Job ${issueKey}] Failed to create download attempt record in DB.`);
     throw new Error("Database error: Could not create download attempt."); // Throw to ensure cleanup
}
```

With our changes:
*   If `createDownloadAttempt` returns `null` due to a unique constraint violation (meaning another instance just created it), the `if (!attempt)` condition will be true.
*   It will log: `[Job ISSUE_KEY] Failed to create download attempt record in DB.`
*   It will then `throw new Error(...)`. This error will be caught by the `catch` block in `downloadFile` (around line 543), which will log the failure and, importantly, the `finally` block (around line 557) will run, ensuring `activeDownloads.delete(issueKey)` is called for that specific process.

This means the instance that failed to create the duplicate record will gracefully stop processing that particular `issue_key`, allowing the instance that *did* successfully create the record to proceed.

**Final Steps and Testing:**

1.  **Apply the Database Migration:** Ensure the SQL migration `add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql` is run against your database.
2.  **Restart the Application:** With PM2 running 6 instances.
3.  **Observe Behavior:**
    *   You should no longer see multiple `job_downloads` records being created with the same `issue_key` and identical `started_at` times for new jobs.
    *   In the logs, for a new job, you should see one instance successfully create the attempt, while the other 5 instances should log the "Unique constraint violation" warning from `createDownloadAttempt` and then the "Failed to create download attempt record in DB" message from `downloadFile` before stopping for that job.
    *   The "stuck" job issue (like GLBAY-17104, attempt 14311) should be resolved for *newly processed jobs* because only one attempt will be created and managed.
    *   The previous fixes for handling jobs stuck in 'queued' during a restart will now work more reliably because they won't be confused by multiple competing attempts.

This addresses the root cause of the duplicate attempts and should make the entire download and retry process much more stable and predictable.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I've implemented a comprehensive solution to address both the issue of downloads getting stuck after a restart and the underlying concurrency problem causing multiple download attempts for the same job.

Here's a summary of the key changes:

1.  **Concurrency Control (Primary Fix):**
    *   Identified that PM2 running 6 instances (`instances: 6` in `backend/ecosystem.config.cjs`) was causing a race condition, leading to multiple simultaneous download attempts for the same job.
    *   Created a database migration (`backend/src/db/migrations/add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql`) to add a unique partial index to the `job_downloads` table. This index prevents multiple active (e.g., 'queued', 'downloading') records for the same `issue_key`.
    *   Modified the `createDownloadAttempt` function in `backend/src/services/database/jobDownloads.js` to gracefully handle the unique constraint violation (error code `23505`). If an instance tries to create a duplicate active attempt, it will now recognize this, log a warning, and allow the instance that successfully created the record to proceed.

2.  **Improved Restart and Retry Logic (Secondary Fix, building on previous steps):**
    *   The `resetStuckDownloads` function in `backend/src/services/downloader.js` now correctly marks jobs that were 'queued' (in addition to 'downloading') at the time of a restart as 'failed'.
    *   The `retryFailedDownload` function in `backend/src/services/jobMonitor.js` now actively re-initiates downloads by calling `downloadFile` directly after fetching necessary job details (using `getJobDetailsForAttempt` in `backend/src/services/database/jobs.js`).

With these changes, the system should now:
*   Prevent multiple instances from downloading the same file simultaneously.
*   Reliably handle and retry jobs that were interrupted by a server restart, including those that were in a 'queued' state.

This should lead to a more stable and predictable download process. Remember to apply the new database migration.

**Assistant:**

Okay, I have the database connection string from the [`backend/.env`](backend/.env:2) file:
`DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:Pg2024Admin@localhost:5433/jira_data_pipeline`

Now, I will construct the command to apply the specific migration file [`backend/src/db/migrations/add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql`](backend/src/db/migrations/add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql) using `psql`.

This command will connect to the database and execute the SQL content of the migration file.

<execute_command>
<command>psql "postgresql://postgres:Pg2024Admin@localhost:5433/jira_data_pipeline" -f backend/src/db/migrations/add_unique_index_to_active_job_downloads.sql</command>
</execute_command>
