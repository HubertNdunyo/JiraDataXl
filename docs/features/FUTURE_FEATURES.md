## Implementation Strategy

1. **Security First**: Implement authentication and authorization before exposing to production
2. **User Value**: Focus on features that provide immediate value (real-time updates, analytics)
3. **Incremental Rollout**: Deploy features behind feature flags
4. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize as user base grows
5. **Feedback Loop**: Gather user feedback to prioritize features

## Technology Considerations

- **State Management**: Consider Redux or Zustand for complex state
- **UI Components**: Expand shadcn/ui component usage
- **Backend**: Consider moving to async PostgreSQL driver
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and caching
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or Redis for background jobs
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

## Success Metrics

- User adoption rate
- Average session duration
- Feature usage analytics
- Performance metrics (page load, API response times)
- Error rates and system stability
- User satisfaction scores
